#Parameters --> explain parameters here (to be done) --> only changed epilimnion depth and surface area
#
#compType: type of compartment
#surfaceArea_m2: surface area of the compartment in m2 (for lake, this will be equal for all compartments
#depth_m: depth of the compartment in m
#G: shear rate in 1/s. For sediment this should be 0
#T_K: temperature of the compartment in Kelvin
#add the specification for each paramenter

#smaller lake
