#Parameters 
#
#ID: label of lake compartment (4 in current version)
#compartment: name of compartment (i.e. compartment type). Process information specific to compartment)
#alpha_A: heteroaggregation attachment efficieny for pristine MPs (value between 0 and 1, unitless)
#alpha_C: heteroaggregation attachment efficieny for biofouled MPs (value between 0 and 1, unitless)
#t_half_d_A, t_half_d_B, t_half_d_C, t_half_d_D: half-life time for complete degradation of MP forms A to D (unit: days)
#k_frag_d_A, k_frag_d_B,k_frag_d_C,k_frag_d_D: fragmentation rate constant for MP forms A to D (unit: 1/days)
#t_biof_growth_d: time for biofilm growth of a defined thickness (unit: days)
