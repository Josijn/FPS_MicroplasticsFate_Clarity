#Microplastics input file
#file containing input properties of microplastics to be modelled
#
#
#Parameters 
#
#ID: internal number/label
#name: name to be used in outputs
#composition: polymer type (e.g. PE for polyethylene) or type of SPM/natural colloid (e.g. clay)
#density_kg_m3: density of parent (original) particle in kg/m3
#MPshape: particle shape (sphere, fibre, flake, film, cylinder, ...). Note: only sphere is implemented well throughout the code, for other shape check processes
#diamter_um: (median) diameter in micrometers (for spherical particles)
#length_a_um, length_b_um, length_c_um: individual dimensions in micrometer (for non-spherical particles. For sphere should be left as 0
